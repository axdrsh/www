          most productivity methods, like the pomodoro technique, split your
          work into fixed time blocks: 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. sounds good
          in theory, but in practice? it becomes a timer-watching game. it's
          rigid, easy to cheat, and kind of annoying when you're in flow.
        </p>

          so i flipped it. i call it <strong>reverse pomodoro</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          instead of blocking time, you track it. just start a stopwatch when
          you're actually working. pause when you stop. that's it. every minute
          gets counted. no fake focus. no waiting for a bell.
        </p>

        <p>
          the goal? <em>momentum</em>. watching your real work time stack up
          hits different. it's not about ending a session, it's about building
          momentum.
        </p>

        <p>
          you take breaks when you need to. go long if you're in flow. no guilt.
          no interruptions. no blocks. just raw time and effort, building up.
        </p>

        <p>
          reverse pomodoro isn't about working harder - it's about seeing your
          focus clearly. and once you see it, you want to keep going.

            i even built a little app just for this. dead simple, zero clutter,
            just a clean interface that tracks your real work time across
            different projects. check it out here:{" "}
